NestJS requires Node version >= 16. This is higher than the latest
Node version available on the Ubuntu repositories for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
As such make sure you have [nvm] installed and use:
        
         nvm use lts/iron

... or some other appropriate version prior to working with this project.
